## Possible Improvements

As I was running out of time, here's what I could have implemented over the scope :

 - Using Pinia to manage the state instead of querying the API on every click
 - Using LoadingOverlay to display a loading spinner when fetching data
 - Using Vue Router to implement a more complex routing system
 - Implementing a more complex filtering system
 - CI/CD pipeline integration with auto deployment

## BONUS ðŸ¤˜

The app is deployed to netlify at : [https://idt-nrs.netlify.app/](https://idt-nrs.netlify.app/)

Each push on master will trigger a new deployment

You just need to have a running backend at `http://localhost:6868` to make it work
